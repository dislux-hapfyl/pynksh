# sh2py
A different way to manipulate text and build apps using Tkinter, Python and Shell together.

Shell function mapper^ that wraps Python syntax as a small tool to write less but more.

## How to operate

^_it sources the file `pnk.lang` before running the shell commands using `subprocess`._

Launch from terminal: `ksh newide | python3 &` (bash works fine too)

_run the above command in the same directory as `pnk.lang`_


## Reasoning

  - Increased productivity: If your app helps you produce 250% more characters with less typing, you can write more code in less time, allowing you to accomplish more tasks or focus on other aspects of your projects.


   - Error reduction: Typing less code might also mean making fewer typing errors or syntax errors, which can lead to a more efficient debug and review process.


  -  Code standardization: Your tool might help maintain a consistent coding style across a project if it automates certain patterns or structures, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.


   - Faster learning: For new developers or those less familiar with a specific coding language, your tool can serve as a learning aid by providing ready-to-use code snippets or structures.


  -  Repetitive task relief: Automating repetitive coding tasks can be a relief for developers, giving them more time to focus on unique, complex problems and overall architecture decisions.


   - Improved focus: With less need to think about routine code, developers can focus on the logic and algorithms that are central to the app's functionality.


   - Scalability: You can manage larger projects more easily if your tool enables you to maintain and generate code efficiently.


   - Economic efficiency: Saving time on typing and debugging directly translates into cost savings, as less time is needed to develop and maintain the software.


   - Accessibility: This tool can make coding more accessible to people who might have limitations that make typing difficult, therefore expanding the pool of potential developers who can contribute to projects.


Overall, a tool that enhances coding speed and efficiency can be highly beneficial in a fast-paced development environment where time and accuracy are paramount.
