# pynksh

shell functions that wrap python syntax

a small tool to help write shorthand "python" in shell


## How to operate

Launch the IDE from terminal: `ksh newide | python3 &`

Inspect from newide: 
  
  `Ctrl-q` View `newide`
  
  `Ctrl-Shift-q` View `pnk.lang`
  

## Ideas

would making this better be worth it to anyone? 


## Contact

let's talk on Discord so we can understand my concoction


## History
`the seed is in the legacy folder`


## Reasoning

my main argument: typing 20-50% of the characters = faster app production + joy


+Build Your Dream Python Project (+BYDPP) | Coding - Programming - GPT-4 Discord

Prompt:
`I created something to reduce the amount of code I type so my app helps me produce 250% more characters. In what way can this be useful`

  - Increased productivity: If your app helps you produce 250% more characters with less typing, you can write more code in less time, allowing you to accomplish more tasks or focus on other aspects of your projects.


   - Error reduction: Typing less code might also mean making fewer typing errors or syntax errors, which can lead to a more efficient debug and review process.


  -  Code standardization: Your tool might help maintain a consistent coding style across a project if it automates certain patterns or structures, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.


   - Faster learning: For new developers or those less familiar with a specific coding language, your tool can serve as a learning aid by providing ready-to-use code snippets or structures.


  -  Repetitive task relief: Automating repetitive coding tasks can be a relief for developers, giving them more time to focus on unique, complex problems and overall architecture decisions.


   - Improved focus: With less need to think about routine code, developers can focus on the logic and algorithms that are central to the app's functionality.


   - Scalability: You can manage larger projects more easily if your tool enables you to maintain and generate code efficiently.


   - Economic efficiency: Saving time on typing and debugging directly translates into cost savings, as less time is needed to develop and maintain the software.


   - Accessibility: This tool can make coding more accessible to people who might have limitations that make typing difficult, therefore expanding the pool of potential developers who can contribute to projects.


Overall, a tool that enhances coding speed and efficiency can be highly beneficial in a fast-paced development environment where time and accuracy are paramount.
